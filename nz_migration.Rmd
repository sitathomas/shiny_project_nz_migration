## Data Preparation

Data can be downloaded at: http://archive.stats.govt.nz/infoshare/
Subject Categories > Tourism > International Travel and Migration

```{r preprocessing}

raw <- read_csv("data/ITM359302_20200428_125710_33.csv", col_names = T, skip = 3)
View(raw)

data <- separate(raw, X1, c("year", "quarter"), sep = "Q")
	
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
